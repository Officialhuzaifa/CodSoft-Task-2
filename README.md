## 🎯 Overview

With the exponential growth of online streaming platforms, **recommendation systems and movie rating prediction** have become essential for improving user experience.  

This project aims to **predict movie ratings** (on a 1–5 or 1–10 scale) using **historical data** and various features such as user preferences, genres, and cast details.  

It demonstrates how **machine learning models** can learn from user behavior and movie metadata to make accurate predictions.

## ✨ Features

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on movie datasets  
✅ Preprocessing of textual and categorical features (genres, cast, etc.)  
✅ Feature engineering — popularity score, average rating, review count  
✅ Machine Learning models for predicting movie ratings  
✅ Model evaluation using metrics like **RMSE** and **MAE**
