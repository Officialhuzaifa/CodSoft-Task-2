 Movie Rating Prediction
This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features like user preferences, genres, cast, and other metadata using machine learning models.

 Overview
With the exponential growth in online streaming platforms, user-based and content-based recommendations have become essential. In this project, we build a predictive model that can estimate movie ratings (e.g., on a 1–5 or 1–10 scale) using historical data.

 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on movie datasets

Preprocessing of textual and categorical features (e.g., genres, cast)

Feature engineering (e.g., popularity score, average rating, review count)

Machine Learning models for rating prediction

Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAE

Dataset
We used the MovieLens dataset (or mention your custom dataset). It includes:

movies.csv – movie metadata (title, genre, etc.)

ratings.csv – user ratings

users.csv – user demographics (if applicable)

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

(Optional: XGBoost, LightGBM, or deep learning models)
